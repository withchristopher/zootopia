     There are two important takeaways from this code:

The first is that the get() method requires two arguments. The first is a string that describes the route the client will have to fetch from. The second is a callback function that will execute every time that route is accessed with a GET request.

The second takeaway is that we are using the send() method from the res parameter (short for response) to send the string Hello! to our client.

    Difference between Development and Production:
    Dev environment, local environment on your machine. Nothing developed affects production.
    Separate keys and config files. All code tested.
    Release: Users get updates first,
    Development:
    Staging: Add a layer of QA, helps test changes, replica of production environment.
    Production: Tested, Production Database (Cloud hosted). ENV vairables separate to Dev variables.
    - Cloud hosted
    - Separate to
    Enterprise: AWS, Azure
